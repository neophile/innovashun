Assassination Note
Unknown
You will kill @player;.
@player; is not to be taken lightly - he has already killed a many of your kind. After killing him, I want you to take any valuables you get off him and bring them to me. If possible, bring me his body so that I may "examine" it.

I do believe that you will find the amount of gold satisfactory. Try not to screw this up, because this is very important and in no way an easy task.

Good Luck. You need it.
