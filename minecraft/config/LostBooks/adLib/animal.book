My Animal
@c.noun.name;
Swooping down like #a; @noun.living;, I snatch my prey with @adjective; talons and fierce @noun.object.plural;. I would be #a; @animal;, #a; @noun.living;-man with #a; @noun.living;'s head, #a; @noun.living;'s talons, the @noun.object; of a scorpion, and the wings of #a; @noun.living;.

"Why?" some may eloquently ask. Because @animal;s are @adverb; @noun.object;, that's why, dumb@noun.object.plural;!
